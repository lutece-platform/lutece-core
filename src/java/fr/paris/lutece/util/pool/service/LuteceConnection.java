/**
 * Wraps a connection to use {@link ConnectionPool} when closing with ({@link #close()}). The actual close is done by {@link #closeConnection()}. <br>
 * Lutece needs the {@link #close()} method to return the connection to the pool. Lutece classes (like DAOUtil uses
 * {@link LuteceConnectionService#freeConnection(Connection)} ), but external libraries (such as hibernate) closes connection directly. This interface is a
 * workaround for Connection incompatibilities from java5 to java6. It should be remove as soon as Lutece drop java5 compatibility. No wrapper delegation is
 * possible implementing Connection interface and wrapping one connection. Actually, implementing java5 java.sql.Connection will cause compilation error with
 * jdk6 (not overriding methods), while implementing java6 java.sql.Connection will also cause compilation errors with jdk5 (no such class found).
